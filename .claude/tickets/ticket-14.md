# Ticket #14: Complete Learning Objectives Workflow Integration

**Status:** Ready  
**Priority:** High  
**Complexity:** Medium (3-4 hours)  
**Type:** Feature Enhancement  

## Summary
Integrate the comprehensive learning objectives system into the main assignment creation workflow to provide educators with full access to Bloom's taxonomy, assessment criteria, and educational scaffolding features.

## Background
The platform currently has two assignment creation paths:
1. **Basic path**: `CreateAssignmentPage` → `AssignmentForm` (simplified 3-step form)
2. **Advanced path**: `AssignmentCreationWizard` (comprehensive 4-step wizard with learning objectives)

The advanced path with full educational features exists but isn't accessible through the main workflow, limiting the platform's educational value.

## Requirements

### Primary Goal
Replace the basic assignment creation workflow with the advanced educational workflow to ensure all educators have access to learning objectives, Bloom's taxonomy integration, and assessment criteria features.

### Technical Requirements
1. **Update `CreateAssignmentPage.tsx`** to use `AssignmentCreationWizard` instead of `AssignmentForm`
2. **Ensure backend integration** for learning objectives data persistence in assignments
3. **Add proper validation** for learning objectives workflow completion
4. **Test complete data flow** from learning objective selection through assignment save
5. **Maintain backwards compatibility** with existing assignment data structure

### User Experience Requirements
1. **Seamless educator workflow**: Course creation → Assignment creation with learning objectives
2. **Clear educational guidance**: Help text explaining Bloom's taxonomy and assessment criteria
3. **Flexible objective selection**: Mix of preset and custom learning objectives
4. **Weight validation**: Ensure learning objective weights add up appropriately
5. **Save/resume capability**: Allow educators to save partial work and return later

### Data Requirements
1. **Learning objectives persistence**: Properly save selected objectives with assignments
2. **Assessment criteria storage**: Store custom and modified assessment criteria
3. **Bloom's taxonomy tracking**: Maintain category and level information
4. **Weight distribution**: Save and validate objective weight allocations

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Definition of Done
- [ ] `CreateAssignmentPage` uses `AssignmentCreationWizard` as primary creation method
- [ ] Full learning objectives workflow is accessible from main navigation
- [ ] Learning objectives data properly saves and loads with assignments
- [ ] Bloom's taxonomy integration works throughout the creation process
- [ ] Assessment criteria can be customized and saved
- [ ] Weight validation prevents invalid objective distributions
- [ ] All existing assignment creation functionality remains intact
- [ ] Manual testing confirms complete educator workflow works end-to-end

### Edge Cases to Handle
- [ ] Empty learning objectives list (require at least one objective)
- [ ] Weight distribution errors (total not equal to 100%)
- [ ] Custom objective validation (require description and valid category)
- [ ] Backend API error handling for learning objectives operations
- [ ] Large number of learning objectives (performance considerations)

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Modify
1. **`frontend/src/pages/CreateAssignmentPage.tsx`**
   - Replace `AssignmentForm` import with `AssignmentCreationWizard`
   - Update component usage and props
   - Ensure proper navigation and state management

2. **`frontend/src/components/assignments/AssignmentCreationWizard.tsx`**
   - Verify learning objectives integration is complete
   - Add any missing validation or error handling
   - Ensure proper data submission to backend

3. **Backend Integration (if needed)**
   - Verify assignment model supports learning objectives storage
   - Test API endpoints for creating assignments with learning objectives
   - Add validation for learning objectives data structure

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Verify component integration and data flow
2. **Integration Tests**: Test complete assignment creation with learning objectives
3. **Manual Testing**: Complete educator workflow from course to assignment creation
4. **Error Testing**: Validate error handling for edge cases

## Educational Impact

### Platform Differentiation
This ticket completes the core educational differentiation of the platform by making advanced pedagogical features accessible through the standard workflow, distinguishing it from generic LMS systems.

### Educator Benefits
- **Structured Learning Design**: Bloom's taxonomy integration guides proper learning objective creation
- **Assessment Alignment**: Clear connection between learning objectives and assessment criteria
- **Educational Best Practices**: Built-in guidance for creating meaningful writing assignments
- **Process Visibility**: Transparent learning objective tracking for institutional reporting

### Alignment with Project Mission
Directly supports the mission to "transform writing education by making the writing process visible and collaborative" by ensuring all assignments are built on solid educational foundations with clear learning outcomes.

## Dependencies
- ✅ Ticket #11: Learning Objectives Preset System (completed)
- ✅ Ticket #13: Learning Objectives Selection Interface (completed)
- ✅ Backend learning objectives API (available)
- ✅ `AssignmentCreationWizard` component (exists)

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 100% of new assignments created through main workflow include learning objectives
- [ ] Zero regression in existing assignment creation functionality
- [ ] Educator feedback confirms improved assignment creation experience
- [ ] Learning objectives data properly persists and displays in assignment management interfaces

## Notes
This ticket is crucial for completing the educational platform's core value proposition. Without this integration, the sophisticated learning objectives system remains inaccessible to most educators, limiting the platform's educational impact.
