# Phase 3B: Educational AI Assistant User Flow

## Overview

This document describes the complete user flow for the Educational AI Assistant Interface (Phase 3B), which implements our "Bounded Enhancement for Learning" AI philosophy. The flow ensures AI assistance enhances critical thinking rather than replacing it.

## Core Philosophy Principles

- **AI enhances thinking, never replaces it**
- **Reflection is mandatory before AI access**
- **Questions over answers - AI never generates content**
- **Complete transparency for educational integrity**
- **Progressive independence building**

## Complete User Flow

### Step 1: AI Assistance Request
**Trigger**: Student clicks "Get AI Help" while working on writing assignment

**Context Captured**:
- Current writing stage (brainstorming, drafting, revising, editing)
- Student skill level (novice, developing, proficient, advanced)
- Instructor-set boundary level (strict, guided, flexible)
- Current document content and word count

### Step 2: Stage-Specific Boundaries Display
**Component**: `StageSpecificBoundaries`

**Interface Elements**:
```typescript
<StageSpecificBoundaries
  currentStage="drafting"
  boundaryLevel="guided"
  studentLevel="developing"
  onActionRequest={handleActionRequest}
/>
```

**Student Sees**:
- **Educational Goals** for current writing stage
- **Available AI Actions** (green cards with checkmarks)
  - Action name, description, educational rationale
  - Examples of what AI will provide
  - Reflection requirement indicators
- **Restricted Actions** (red cards with X marks)
  - Why each action is restricted
  - Alternative approaches to try instead
- **Transition Criteria** to advance to next stage

**Example Available Actions (Drafting Stage)**:
- ✅ Structural Questions: "AI asks about organization and flow"
- ✅ Audience Awareness Questions: "AI helps consider reader perspective"
- ✅ Evidence Questions: "AI asks about support for claims"

**Example Restricted Actions**:
- ❌ Generate Sentences: "Sentence crafting develops writing fluency"
- ❌ Improve Paragraphs: "Revision skills must be developed personally"

### Step 3: Action Selection
**User Action**: Student clicks on an available AI action

**System Response**:
- Validates action is allowed for current stage/boundary level
- Checks if reflection is required for this action
- Routes to appropriate next step

### Step 4: Mandatory Reflection (If Required)
**Component**: `ReflectionQualityInterface`

**Reflection Prompts** (Stage-Specific):

**Brainstorming Stage**:
- "What specific aspects of this topic are you most uncertain about?"
- "What do you already know that might be relevant?"
- "What questions are driving your curiosity about this topic?"
- "How does this connect to your previous writing or learning experiences?"

**Drafting Stage**:
- "Where are you getting stuck in your writing?"
- "What organizational choices have you made and why?"
- "How are you deciding what to include or exclude?"
- "What voice or tone are you trying to achieve?"

**Interface Requirements**:
- Minimum word count (100-150 words depending on stage)
- Real-time word counter
- Submit/Skip options with consequences explained

### Step 5: Reflection Assessment
**Algorithm**: Multi-criteria analysis of reflection quality

**Assessment Criteria**:
- **Specificity** (0-100): Concrete examples vs. generic statements
- **Metacognition** (0-100): Thinking about thinking processes  
- **Connection** (0-100): Links to prior learning/experience
- **Growth** (0-100): Recognition of learning/change
- **Application** (0-100): Future application insights

**Quality Levels**:
- **Surface** (0-40): Generic responses, no specific examples
- **Developing** (40-60): Some specificity, basic connections
- **Deep** (60-75): Specific examples, clear metacognition
- **Transformative** (75+): Rich examples, sophisticated connections

**AI Access Granted**:
- **Surface**: Minimal access (basic questions only)
- **Developing**: Guided access (structured prompts)
- **Deep/Transformative**: Full access (comprehensive assistance)

### Step 6: Educational AI Assistance
**Component**: `EducationalAICoach`

**Student Input Required**:
- **Learning Objective**: "I want to improve paragraph transitions"
- **Specific Question**: "How can I better connect my ideas between paragraphs 2 and 3?"
- **Content Context**: Relevant portion of their writing

**AI Response Types** (Never generates content):
- **Questions**: "What relationship exists between these two ideas?"
- **Prompts**: "Consider how your reader experiences this transition"
- **Perspectives**: "How might reorganizing help clarity?"
- **Challenges**: "What would critics say about this connection?"

**Educational Rationale**: Each response includes why this helps learning

### Step 7: Contribution Tracking
**Component**: `AIContributionTracker`

**Automatic Logging**:
```typescript
{
  id: "contrib-123",
  timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  writingStage: "drafting",
  contributionType: "question",
  aiContent: ["What relationship exists between these ideas?"],
  studentRequest: "Help with paragraph transitions",
  studentReflection: "I realize my paragraphs jump topics without clear connections...",
  reflectionQuality: "deep",
  educationalRationale: "Questions develop organizational thinking",
  documentSection: "Paragraphs 2-3",
  wordCountBefore: 450,
  wordCountAfter: 450, // No direct generation
  isIncorporated: false,
  incorporationNote: undefined
}
```

### Step 8: Student Integration
**Student Actions**:
- Works with AI questions/prompts
- Revises their writing based on insights
- Marks whether they incorporated AI guidance
- Adds optional note about how they used it

**System Updates**:
- `isIncorporated: true`
- `incorporationNote: "Restructured paragraphs 2-3 for better flow"`
- `wordCountAfter: 485`

### Step 9: Transparency Dashboard
**Component**: `AIContributionTracker` (Summary View)

**Analytics Displayed**:
- **Educational Value**: High/Medium/Low based on reflection quality + incorporation
- **Total Contributions**: Count of AI interactions
- **Incorporation Rate**: Percentage of suggestions actually used
- **Average Reflection Quality**: Trend over time
- **Words per Contribution**: Impact on document length

**Complete History**:
- Chronological list of all AI interactions
- Filter by writing stage, contribution type
- Detailed view of each interaction
- Export capability for educator review
