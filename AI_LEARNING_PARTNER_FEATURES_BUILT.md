# AI Learning Partner Features Built in Scribe Tree

## Executive Summary

Scribe Tree has successfully built a comprehensive AI Learning Partner system that aligns with the business vision of "productive friction" and capability development. The system implements sophisticated educational AI features across 6 MCP servers, each focused on different aspects of supporting student learning while maintaining educational integrity and privacy.

## Core Philosophy Implementation

### Productive Struggle & Bounded Enhancement
