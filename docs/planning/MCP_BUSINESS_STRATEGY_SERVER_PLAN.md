## üö® **Risk Assessment & Mitigation**

### **High-Risk Areas**
1. **Workflow Disruption**
   - **Risk**: MCP server complicates existing smooth insights/reflection process
   - **Mitigation**: Design as enhancement, not replacement; gradual integration
   - **Fallback**: Can revert to existing workflow if integration fails

2. **Data Fragmentation**
   - **Risk**: Strategic data becomes siloed from technical insights
   - **Mitigation**: Strong integration with existing `.claude/` documentation
   - **Monitoring**: Regular audits to ensure information flows correctly

3. **Over-Engineering**
   - **Risk**: Building sophisticated features that don't provide practical value
   - **Mitigation**: Start simple, validate value before adding complexity
   - **Success Criteria**: Each feature must demonstrate clear business benefit

### **Medium-Risk Areas**
1. **Adoption Resistance**
   - **Risk**: New tools require behavior change that doesn't stick
   - **Mitigation**: Design for immediate value, minimal behavior change
   - **Success Metrics**: Regular usage without forcing or reminders

2. **Technical Complexity**
   - **Risk**: MCP server development takes longer than planned
   - **Mitigation**: Phased approach allows early value delivery
   - **Backup Plan**: Manual templates if automated tools delayed

3. **Strategic Accuracy**
   - **Risk**: Poor strategic predictions undermine tool credibility
   - **Mitigation**: Conservative forecasting, clear confidence indicators
   - **Learning**: Improve predictions through feedback loop
