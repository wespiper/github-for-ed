## ‚ö° **Pro Tips**

1. **Natural Language**: Ask questions naturally - the MCP server understands context
2. **Combine Operations**: "Search for X, then analyze relationships with Y"
3. **Filter Smart**: Use document types and categories for focused results
4. **Track Progress**: Regularly check project context to stay aligned with goals
5. **Link Everything**: Create tasks that reference specific documents for better organization

## üîÑ **Real-time Updates**

The server automatically:
- **Monitors file changes** in `/docs` and `/.claude`
- **Updates search index** when documents are modified
- **Tracks document relationships** as they evolve
- **Maintains project context** across sessions

## üõ† **Troubleshooting**

If something isn't working:

1. **Check Server Status**: The MCP server should show "initialized" in logs
2. **Verify Permissions**: Ensure Claude Code can access the MCP server
3. **Rebuild Index**: If search seems incomplete, the server rebuilds automatically
4. **Check Paths**: Verify the PROJECT_ROOT environment variable is correct

## üéâ **Ready to Use!**

Your documentation is now intelligently accessible through Claude Code. The MCP server provides deep context about your educational platform, development philosophy, and implementation progress.

Try starting with:
```
"What's the current status of the Scribe Tree project and what should I focus on next?"
```

The MCP server will provide comprehensive context from your 49 indexed documents to help guide your development work!
