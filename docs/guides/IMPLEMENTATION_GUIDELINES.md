# Scribe Tree Implementation Guidelines

This guide provides comprehensive guidelines for implementing features in the Scribe Tree platform, focusing on user experience, educational context, and quality standards.

## User Experience Principles

1. **Invisible Complexity**: "Good design is invisible - when done right, users don't notice it because everything feels natural, intuitive, and easy to use"
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show essential features first, reveal advanced options as needed
3. **Educational Context**: Every interface should clearly serve writing instruction
4. **Process Visibility**: Make the invisible writing process explicit and meaningful
5. **Professional Polish**: Interface quality that justifies institutional adoption

## UI/UX Standards

### Interface Design
- **No modal dialogs** for complex course/assignment creation workflows
- **Full-page experiences** for important educational configuration
- **Writing-specific terminology** throughout (not generic "content" or "lessons")
- **Visual hierarchy** that guides users through complex decisions
- **Contextual help** that explains educational concepts and best practices

### Component Guidelines
- Use consistent spacing and typography
- Maintain clear visual relationships between elements
- Provide immediate feedback for user actions
- Include loading states for async operations
- Design for both desktop and tablet use

### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- Keyboard navigation for all interactions
- Screen reader announcements for dynamic content
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Focus indicators for interactive elements
