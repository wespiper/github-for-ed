```
Orchestrator → Service A → Service B → Service C → Aggregated Response
```

#### 4. Circuit Breaker Protected
```
Client → Circuit Breaker → Primary Service (or Fallback)
```

## Privacy-First Distributed Architecture

### Cross-Service Privacy Protection

#### Privacy Context Propagation
```typescript
interface PrivacyContext {
  studentId: string;           // Hashed student identifier
  consentLevel: ConsentLevel;  // Privacy permissions
  purpose: string;             // Educational justification
  dataRetention: number;       // TTL for sensitive data
}
```
