5. **Integration**: Email/LMS messaging

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Intervention Workflow System
- [ ] Create `InterventionWorkflow.tsx` with stages:
  1. Trigger identification
  2. Intervention selection
  3. Customization
  4. Delivery
  5. Follow-up
  6. Outcome tracking
- [ ] Build `InterventionTriggers.tsx`:
  - Cognitive overload sustained
  - Reflection quality decline
  - AI boundary frustration
  - Engagement drop
  - Peer comparison alerts
- [ ] Add workflow templates:
  - Quick encouragement
  - Detailed guidance
  - Parent notification
  - Peer support activation

### Step 2: Intervention Composer
- [ ] Build `InterventionComposer.tsx` featuring:
  - Template library
  - Variable insertion (student name, context)
  - Tone adjustment options
  - Preview before sending
  - Multi-channel delivery
- [ ] Create smart templates:
  ```typescript
  "Hi {studentName}, I noticed you're working hard on 
   {assignmentTitle}. Your {strengthArea} is really 
   showing improvement! Let's talk about {challengeArea}..."
  ```
- [ ] Add personalization AI suggestions
- [ ] Include scheduling options

### Step 3: Effectiveness Tracking
- [ ] Implement `InterventionEffectiveness.tsx`:
  - Response rates
  - Behavior change metrics
  - Quality improvements
  - Time to improvement
  - A/B test results
- [ ] Create visual timeline:
  - Intervention sent
  - Student response
  - Behavior changes
  - Outcome achieved
- [ ] Build recommendation engine:
  - What worked for similar students
  - Optimal timing patterns
  - Message type effectiveness

### Step 4: Parent Communication
- [ ] Create `ParentCommunication.tsx` with:
  - Progress summaries
  - Celebration messages
  - Concern notifications
  - Meeting requests
- [ ] Build `ProgressReportGenerator.tsx`:
  - Visual progress charts
  - Specific examples
  - Growth narratives
  - Next steps
- [ ] Add communication preferences:
  - Frequency settings
  - Channel selection
  - Language options
- [ ] Include privacy controls

### Step 5: Assignment Feedback Tools
- [ ] Build `AssignmentFeedback.tsx` supporting:
  - Inline comments on student work
  - Voice note attachments
  - Rubric connections
  - Growth-focused language
- [ ] Create `FeedbackTemplates.tsx`:
  - Encouraging starters
  - Constructive middles
  - Forward-looking endings
- [ ] Add AI-powered suggestions:
  - Based on student profile
  - Previous effective feedback
  - Learning objectives
- [ ] Track feedback impact

### Step 6: Support Resource Library
- [ ] Implement `SupportResources.tsx` containing:
  - Writing guides
  - Video tutorials
  - Example assignments
  - Peer success stories
- [ ] Create `ResourceRecommender.tsx`:
  - Based on struggle patterns
  - Matched to learning style
  - Difficulty appropriate
- [ ] Add resource effectiveness tracking
- [ ] Enable resource sharing between educators

## Code Locations
- **Interventions**: `frontend/src/components/educator/interventions/`
- **Communication**: `frontend/src/components/educator/communication/`
- **Reports**: `frontend/src/components/educator/reports/`
- **Resources**: `frontend/src/components/educator/resources/`
- **Services**: `frontend/src/services/interventionService.ts`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Interventions improve outcomes 40%+
- [ ] Teachers report time savings
- [ ] Parents feel informed and involved
- [ ] Students respond positively
- [ ] Feedback turnaround decreases
- [ ] Resource usage increases
- [ ] Privacy maintained throughout

## API Integration
```typescript
// Intervention endpoints
POST /api/interventions/create
GET /api/interventions/history/:studentId
POST /api/interventions/track-outcome
GET /api/interventions/effectiveness

// Communication endpoints  
POST /api/communications/send-parent
POST /api/communications/schedule
GET /api/communications/templates
POST /api/reports/generate-progress

// Analytics
GET /api/analytics/intervention-outcomes
GET /api/analytics/feedback-impact
```

## Message Template System
```typescript
interface InterventionTemplate {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: 'encouragement' | 'guidance' | 'concern';
  variables: string[];
  tone: 'warm' | 'professional' | 'urgent';
  channels: ('in-app' | 'email' | 'sms')[];
  effectiveness: number; // 0-100 based on outcomes
}
```

## Privacy Considerations
- Parent access requires consent
- Student work samples anonymized
- Communication logs encrypted
- Intervention details protected
- Effectiveness data aggregated

## Reference Documents
- [Intervention Engine](../../backend/src/services/InterventionEngine.ts)
- [Educator Alerts System](../../mcp-servers/educator-alerts/README.md)
- [Privacy Guidelines](../../docs/guides/PRIVACY_COMPLIANCE_TESTING_GUIDE.md)

## Notes
- Focus on human connection, not automation
- Templates should feel personal, not robotic
- Track effectiveness to improve over time
- Make parent communication easy but not intrusive
- Test with educators for real workflow fit
