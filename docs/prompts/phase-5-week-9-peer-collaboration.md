# Phase 5 Week 9: Peer Learning Network

## Objective
Implement privacy-first peer collaboration features that enable students to learn from each other without competition, fostering collective intelligence while protecting individual privacy.

## Context
- **Current Phase**: Phase 5 - Frontend Integration
- **Week**: Week 9 (Sprint 5)
- **Branch**: `feat/phase-5-frontend`
- **Dependencies**: Core editor and analytics complete

## Scope
### In Scope
- Anonymous approach sharing
- Peer insight voting system
- Collective intelligence visualization
- Breakthrough gallery
- Study group formation
- Privacy consent management

### Out of Scope
- Direct messaging between students
- Video collaboration
- Competitive rankings
- Social media features

## Technical Requirements
1. **Privacy**: All sharing anonymized by default
2. **Consent**: Explicit opt-in for any sharing
3. **Real-time**: WebSocket for live collaboration
4. **Moderation**: Educator oversight options
5. **Scale**: Support 1000+ concurrent users

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Privacy-First Sharing Framework
- [ ] Create `PrivacySharingConsent.tsx` with:
  - Clear value exchange explanation
  - Granular control options
  - Visual consent indicators
  - Revocation interface
- [ ] Build `AnonymizationEngine.tsx`:
  - Remove identifying information
  - Preserve educational value
  - Maintain context
  - Generate anonymous IDs
- [ ] Implement consent states:
  ```typescript
  type ConsentLevel = 
    | 'none'        // No sharing
    | 'anonymous'   // Share anonymized only
    | 'classroom'   // Share with class
    | 'institution' // Share school-wide
  ```

### Step 2: Approach Sharing System
- [ ] Build `ApproachSharing.tsx` allowing:
  - Share idea maze paths
  - Share argument structures
  - Share revision strategies
  - Share breakthrough moments
- [ ] Create `ApproachCard.tsx` displaying:
  - Anonymized approach
  - Context (assignment type)
  - Effectiveness indicators
  - Adoption count
- [ ] Add filtering/searching:
  - By assignment
  - By effectiveness
  - By recency
  - By similarity

### Step 3: Peer Insight Voting
- [ ] Implement `InsightVoting.tsx` with:
  - Helpful/not helpful voting
  - Insight quality indicators
  - Comment system (moderated)
  - Thank you messages
- [ ] Create voting analytics:
  - Most helpful approaches
  - Trending strategies
  - Underrated gems
- [ ] Build reputation system:
  - Helper score (private)
  - Contribution quality
  - No public rankings

### Step 4: Collective Intelligence Map
- [ ] Design `CollectiveIntelligenceMap.tsx`:
  - Network visualization of ideas
  - Connection strength indicators
  - Cluster identification
  - Evolution over time
- [ ] Use D3.js force layout:
  - Nodes: Individual approaches
  - Edges: Similarity/influence
  - Clusters: Common strategies
  - Size: Adoption rate
- [ ] Add exploration tools:
  - Zoom to clusters
  - Filter by success
  - Time-lapse view

### Step 5: Breakthrough Gallery
- [ ] Create `BreakthroughGallery.tsx` showcasing:
  - Anonymized "aha" moments
  - Before/after comparisons
  - Journey narratives
  - Inspiring struggles
- [ ] Build submission flow:
  - Student nominates breakthrough
  - Auto-anonymization
  - Educator approval
  - Gallery publication
- [ ] Add engagement features:
  - Inspiration reactions
  - Similar journey finder
  - Private bookmarking

### Step 6: Study Group Formation
- [ ] Implement `StudyGroupMatcher.tsx` using:
  - Complementary strengths
  - Similar struggles
  - Schedule compatibility
  - Learning style match
- [ ] Create `StudyGroupSpace.tsx`:
  - Shared workspace
  - Group idea maze
  - Collaborative notes
  - Progress tracking
- [ ] Add privacy controls:
  - Opt-in only
  - Leave anytime
  - Data boundaries
  - Educator visibility options

## Code Locations
- **Collaboration**: `frontend/src/components/collaboration/`
- **Privacy**: `frontend/src/components/collaboration/privacy/`
- **Visualizations**: `frontend/src/components/collaboration/visualizations/`
- **Services**: `frontend/src/services/collaborationService.ts`
- **Hooks**: `frontend/src/hooks/useCollaboration.ts`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 70%+ students share something
- [ ] No privacy complaints
- [ ] Helpful votes exceed 80%
- [ ] Study groups show better outcomes
- [ ] Collective intelligence emerges
- [ ] Students report reduced isolation
- [ ] Educators maintain oversight

## API Integration
```typescript
// Collaboration endpoints
POST /api/collaboration/share-approach
GET /api/collaboration/gallery
POST /api/collaboration/vote
GET /api/collaboration/intelligence-map
POST /api/collaboration/study-groups/match

// Privacy endpoints
POST /api/privacy/consent/update
GET /api/privacy/consent/status
POST /api/privacy/anonymize

// Real-time events
WebSocket: approach-shared
WebSocket: vote-cast
WebSocket: breakthrough-approved
```

## Privacy Design Patterns
- Default to maximum privacy
- Clear value propositions
- Easy consent revocation
- Transparent data use
- No dark patterns
- Student agency respected

## Reference Documents
- [Privacy-First Design](../../docs/guides/PRIVACY_AWARE_SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Student Profiling MCP](../../mcp-servers/student-profiling/README.md)
- [Collaboration Best Practices](../../docs/philosophy/)

## Notes
- Privacy is paramount - no compromise
- Focus on learning, not social features
- Anonymization must be bulletproof
- Value exchange must be clear
- Test with student privacy advocates
