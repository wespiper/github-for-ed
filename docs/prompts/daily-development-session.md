# Daily Development Session Prompt Template

## Objective
**Fill in specific development goal for this session:**
[Clear, specific objective for what you want to accomplish]

## Context
- **Current Phase**: [e.g., Phase 1 - Decouple & Modernize]
- **Week**: [e.g., Week 5 of 20]
- **Branch**: `feat/mcp-microservices-migration`
- **Dependencies**: [Any required setup or previous work completed]

## Scope
### In Scope
- [Specific tasks to complete this session]
- [Files/services to modify]
- [Features to implement]

### Out of Scope
- [What NOT to change]
- [Systems to leave untouched]
- [Future work to defer]

## Technical Requirements
1. **Framework**: [e.g., Fastify 4.x, NestJS 10.x]
2. **Compatibility**: [e.g., Maintain Express API compatibility]
3. **Performance**: [e.g., Target <100ms response time]
4. **Testing**: [e.g., 100% backward compatibility tests]

## Implementation Steps

- [ ] Task 2 with file locations
- [ ] Task 3 with configuration needs

### Step 2: [Core Implementation]
- [ ] Detailed implementation task
- [ ] Code example or pattern to follow
- [ ] Integration points to consider

### Step 3: [Testing & Validation]
- [ ] Unit test requirements
- [ ] Integration test needs
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Step 4: [Documentation & Cleanup]
- [ ] Update relevant docs
- [ ] Clean up temporary code
- [ ] Prepare for next phase

## Code Locations
