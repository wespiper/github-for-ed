# Phase 1 - Week 5: Privacy-Aware Monitoring & Observability

## Important Note
**Since we believe Phase 1 may already be completed, please first assess:**
- Is comprehensive privacy-aware monitoring already implemented with PII protection?
- Are consent tracking and privacy compliance dashboards operational?
- Is data access auditing in place with heat map visualization?
- Are privacy alert systems configured for policy violations?
- If these tasks are already done, document the current privacy monitoring setup and proceed to the next incomplete task.

## Objective
Implement comprehensive privacy-aware monitoring, observability, and compliance tracking systems that provide deep visibility into system operations while strictly protecting student privacy and ensuring regulatory compliance.
