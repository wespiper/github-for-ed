## Privacy-Specific Optimizations

### Encryption Optimization Techniques
```typescript
// Hardware-accelerated AES encryption
interface OptimizedEncryption {
  // Use AES-NI instructions for 10x speedup
  encryptWithHardware(data: Buffer): Promise<Buffer>;
  
  // Batch encryption for multiple records
  encryptBatch(records: Buffer[]): Promise<Buffer[]>;
  
  // Stream encryption for large datasets
  createEncryptStream(): Transform;
}
```

### Privacy-Preserving Cache Design
```typescript
interface PrivacyAwareCache {
  // Encrypted storage with fast symmetric crypto
  setEncrypted(key: string, value: any, ttl: number): Promise<void>;
  
  // Automatic consent-based invalidation
  invalidateOnConsentChange(userId: string): Promise<void>;
  
  // Differential privacy for aggregations
  getCachedAggregation(query: string, epsilon: number): Promise<any>;
}
```

### Efficient Consent Engine
```typescript
interface OptimizedConsentEngine {
  // O(1) consent lookups with bit masking
  checkConsent(userId: string, purpose: ConsentPurpose): boolean;
  
  // Batch consent checking
  checkConsentBatch(requests: ConsentRequest[]): boolean[];
  
  // Pre-computed consent matrix
  precomputeConsentMatrix(): Promise<void>;
}
```
