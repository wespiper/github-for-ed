# Phase 5 Week 5: Progress & Growth Visualization

## Objective
Build meaningful progress visualization components that show actual capability development, thinking depth, and learning journey without gamification elements.

## Context
- **Current Phase**: Phase 5 - Frontend Integration
- **Week**: Week 5 (Sprint 3)
- **Branch**: `feat/phase-5-frontend`
- **Dependencies**: Core editor features complete

## Scope
### In Scope
- Capability growth charts
- Thinking depth indicators
- Independence tracking
- Breakthrough timeline
- Learning journey visualization
- Skill development radar

### Out of Scope
- Points or scores
- Leaderboards
- Badges or trophies
- Competitive elements
- Arbitrary achievements

## Technical Requirements
1. **Visualization**: D3.js for complex charts
2. **Animation**: Framer Motion for transitions
3. **Data**: TanStack Query for analytics
4. **Performance**: Virtualize long timelines
5. **Responsiveness**: Mobile-friendly views

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Capability Growth Chart
- [ ] Create `CapabilityGrowthChart.tsx` using D3.js
- [ ] Visualize multiple dimensions:
  - Critical thinking depth
  - Argument sophistication
  - Evidence quality
  - Independent analysis
- [ ] Use area chart with smooth curves
- [ ] Add time-based x-axis (weeks/months)
- [ ] Include milestone markers for breakthroughs
- [ ] Connect to analytics API:
  ```typescript
  GET /api/analytics/capability-growth/:studentId
  GET /api/analytics/skill-progression/:skillType
  ```

### Step 2: Thinking Depth Indicator
- [ ] Build `ThinkingDepthMeter.tsx` showing:
  - Current depth level (1-10 scale)
  - Historical progression
  - Factors contributing to score
  - Areas for growth
- [ ] Design as elegant gauge, not game meter
- [ ] Add contextual explanations on hover
- [ ] Update in real-time during writing
- [ ] Use color gradients for depth levels

### Step 3: Independence Tracker
- [ ] Create `IndependenceMeter.tsx` tracking:
  - AI assistance requests over time
  - Self-directed exploration
  - Autonomous problem solving
  - Quality without AI help
- [ ] Visualize as declining curve (less AI = good)
- [ ] Add celebration for independence milestones
- [ ] Include peer comparison (anonymized)
- [ ] Show correlation with capability growth

### Step 4: Breakthrough Timeline
- [ ] Build `BreakthroughTimeline.tsx` component:
  - Vertical timeline with entries
  - Each breakthrough has context
  - Links to relevant documents
  - Shows thinking evolution
- [ ] Categories of breakthroughs:
  - Conceptual insights
  - Method discoveries
  - Connection moments
  - Independence achievements
- [ ] Add filtering and search
- [ ] Export for portfolio use

### Step 5: Learning Journey Map
- [ ] Design `LearningJourneyMap.tsx` as:
  - Non-linear path visualization
  - Nodes for major learnings
  - Connections between concepts
  - Current position indicator
- [ ] Not a game map - academic journey
- [ ] Show completed and upcoming areas
- [ ] Link to relevant assignments
- [ ] Highlight personal growth story

### Step 6: Skill Development Radar
- [ ] Create `SkillRadarChart.tsx` displaying:
  - Research capabilities
  - Analysis depth
  - Synthesis quality
  - Revision skills
  - Critical thinking
  - Academic writing
- [ ] Compare to past self, not others
- [ ] Show trajectory arrows
- [ ] Add skill descriptions
- [ ] Update based on assignments

## Code Locations
- **Visualizations**: `frontend/src/components/progress/`
- **Charts**: `frontend/src/components/progress/charts/`
- **Hooks**: `frontend/src/hooks/useProgress.ts`
- **Services**: `frontend/src/services/analyticsService.ts`
- **Utils**: `frontend/src/utils/progressCalculations.ts`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Visualizations load quickly (<500ms)
- [ ] Data updates feel real-time
- [ ] Charts are intuitive without explanation
- [ ] Mobile views are functional
- [ ] No gamification elements present
- [ ] Focus on growth, not achievement
- [ ] Accessible to screen readers

## API Integration
```typescript
// Progress endpoints
GET /api/analytics/student-progress/:studentId
GET /api/analytics/capability-metrics
GET /api/analytics/breakthrough-history
GET /api/analytics/skill-assessment

// Real-time updates
WebSocket: progress-updated
WebSocket: breakthrough-detected
WebSocket: milestone-reached
```

## Visual Design Guidelines
- Use smooth gradients, not harsh levels
- Celebrate growth, not completion
- Academic/professional aesthetic
- Muted colors for past, vibrant for current
- Emphasize trajectory over position
- White space for clarity

- [Learning Science Best Practices](../../docs/philosophy/)
- [D3.js Documentation](https://d3js.org/)

## Notes
- These visualizations replace traditional gamification
- Focus on making learning visible, not competitive
- Each chart should tell a growth story
- Avoid arbitrary metrics or scores
- Test with educators for educational value
