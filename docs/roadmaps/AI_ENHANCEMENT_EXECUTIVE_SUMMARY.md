## Philosophical Foundation Enhancements

### Five New Principles to Strengthen Educational Safeguards

1. **The Productive Struggle Principle**
   - Preserves essential difficulty that builds resilience
   - AI supports through challenges, never around them

2. **The Cognitive Load Balance Principle**
   - Dynamic support based on individual capacity
   - Maintains optimal challenge without overwhelming

3. **The Independence Trajectory Principle**
   - Success measured by decreasing AI dependence
   - Explicit goals for intellectual self-sufficiency

4. **The Transfer Learning Principle**
   - Builds reasoning patterns, not assignment tactics
   - Skills must work in AI-free contexts

5. **The Transparent Dependency Principle**
   - Students see their own usage patterns
   - Self-awareness prevents unconscious dependence
