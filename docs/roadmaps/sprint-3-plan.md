# Sprint 3: Real-Time Systems Implementation Plan

## Overview
Sprint 3 focuses on building real-time intervention systems that leverage the intelligence layer from Sprint 2 to provide just-in-time educational support.

## Goals
1. Detect cognitive overload and struggling patterns in real-time
2. Deploy educational interventions at the right moment
3. Alert educators to students needing support
4. Maintain non-intrusive, supportive approach

## Tasks

### 1. Cognitive Load Detection System
**Priority**: HIGH
**Duration**: 2 days

#### Requirements
- Real-time behavioral analysis during writing sessions
- Multiple indicators: deletion ratio, pause patterns, revision cycles
- Personalized baselines from student profiles
- 30-second monitoring intervals
- <100ms processing time

#### Implementation Details
- Integrate with WritingSession activity data
- Use StudentLearningProfile for baseline comparison
- Calculate multi-dimensional load score
- Trigger interventions at appropriate thresholds

### 2. Enhanced Intervention Engine
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Duration**: 2 days

#### Requirements
- Educational support, not correction
- Stage-appropriate interventions
- Respect student autonomy
- Track intervention effectiveness
- No intervention spam (cooldown periods)

#### Intervention Types
- **Gentle Prompts**: "Taking a break can help with clarity"
- **Process Questions**: "What's your main point in this section?"
- **Resource Suggestions**: "This guide might help with structure"
- **Peer Examples**: "See how others approached similar challenges"

### 3. Writing Process Analyzer
**Priority**: HIGH
**Duration**: 1 day

#### Requirements
- Deep pattern analysis across sessions
- Identify breakthrough moments
- Detect improvement patterns
- Generate educator insights
- Maintain performance <500ms

#### Analysis Dimensions
- Writing behavior evolution
- Cognitive pattern shifts
- Independence trajectory
- Quality improvements

### 4. Educator Alert Service
**Priority**: HIGH
**Duration**: 1 day

#### Requirements
- Real-time notifications for educators
- Prioritized by urgency
- Actionable recommendations
- Batch similar alerts
- Respect educator preferences

#### Alert Types
- **Immediate**: Student showing high distress/frustration
- **Important**: Prolonged struggle detected
- **Informational**: Pattern insights available
- **Positive**: Breakthrough moments to celebrate

### 5. Testing & Integration
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Duration**: 1 day

#### Test Scenarios
- Cognitive overload detection accuracy
- Intervention timing appropriateness
- Alert generation and delivery
- Performance under load
- Educational effectiveness

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
WritingSession Activity → CognitiveLoadDetector → Load Score
                ↓
Student Profile + Load Score → InterventionEngine → Intervention
                ↓
Intervention + Context → Student UI (gentle, supportive)
                ↓
Session Summary → EducatorAlertService → Educator Dashboard
```

### Performance Requirements
- Real-time detection: <100ms
- Intervention decision: <200ms
- Alert generation: <500ms
- No blocking of writing flow

## Educational Philosophy Alignment

### Core Principles
1. **Support, Don't Interrupt**: Interventions should feel helpful, not intrusive
2. **Empower, Don't Fix**: Guide students to find their own solutions
3. **Celebrate Progress**: Recognize breakthroughs and improvements
4. **Respect Autonomy**: Students can dismiss or delay interventions

### Intervention Guidelines
- Never tell students what to write
- Ask questions that promote thinking
- Provide resources, not answers
- Focus on process, not product
- Build confidence through support

## Success Metrics
- Cognitive load detection accuracy >85%
- Intervention acceptance rate >70%
- Student frustration reduction >40%
- Educator satisfaction >90%
- Zero "annoying" intervention reports

## Implementation Schedule

### Day 1-2: Cognitive Load Detection
- Build CognitiveLoadDetector service
- Integrate with WritingSession monitoring
- Test with various behavior patterns

### Day 3-4: Intervention Engine
- Create intervention decision logic
- Design intervention templates
- Implement cooldown system

### Day 5: Process Analyzer & Alerts
- Build pattern analysis algorithms
- Create educator alert system
- Integrate all components

### Day 6: Testing & Polish
- Comprehensive integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation

## Next Steps
Begin with CognitiveLoadDetector implementation, building on the real-time monitoring infrastructure from Sprint 2.
