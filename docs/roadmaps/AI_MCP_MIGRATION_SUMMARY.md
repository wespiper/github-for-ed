# AI Services MCP Migration - Executive Summary

## Overview

Convert 13 monolithic AI services into 7 MCP-based microservices over 4 months while strategically upgrading our backend framework to a hybrid Fastify/NestJS architecture, improving scalability, maintainability, performance, and Claude Code integration.

## Current Challenges
- **Tight Coupling**: Services directly call each other and share database access
- **Scalability Limits**: Cannot scale services independently  
- **Maintenance Burden**: Changes ripple across entire system
- **Resource Inefficiency**: All services scale together regardless of demand
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Express.js limiting throughput for high-concurrency AI operations

## Proposed Solution

### 7 MCP Microservices with Strategic Framework Choices

1. **educational-ai-core** (NestJS): Main orchestrator, Claude API integration - complex orchestration benefits from enterprise patterns
2. **writing-analysis** (NestJS): Writing patterns and reflection analysis - complex domain logic suits NestJS structure
3. **student-profiling** (NestJS): Learning profiles and trajectories - data-intensive operations benefit from NestJS patterns
4. **cognitive-monitoring** (Fastify): Real-time behavioral analysis - high-performance requirements suit Fastify
5. **educator-alerts** (Fastify): Alert system and auto-adjustments - simple service with performance needs
6. **academic-integrity** (NestJS): AI detection and integrity monitoring - complex business rules benefit from NestJS
7. **educational-ai-validator** (Fastify): Compliance and philosophy enforcement (existing, minimal refactor)

### Key Benefits
- **10x capacity increase** for concurrent users
- **75-80% faster** response times for AI operations (additional 2-3x from Fastify)
- **Independent scaling** based on service demand
- **Native Claude Code integration** via MCP protocol
- **89% faster deployments** per service
- **Enhanced maintainability** through NestJS enterprise patterns for complex services
- **Optimized performance** with Fastify for high-throughput services

## Migration Timeline

### Phase 1: Decouple & Modernize (Weeks 1-6)
- **Weeks 1-2**: Migrate main API from Express to Fastify (2-3x performance gain)
- **Weeks 2-4**: Implement repository pattern across services
- **Weeks 4-5**: Add event system and abstract cache layer
- **Week 6**: Team training on Fastify and NestJS fundamentals

### Phase 2: Extract Services with Framework Strategy (Weeks 7-12)
- **Weeks 7-8**: Extract `writing-analysis` using NestJS (complex domain logic)
- **Weeks 9-10**: Extract `student-profiling` with NestJS (data-intensive)
- **Weeks 11-12**: Enhance `educational-ai-validator` with Fastify (minimal changes)
- **Continuous**: Establish patterns for NestJS and Fastify MCP servers

### Phase 3: Infrastructure & Performance Services (Weeks 13-16)
- **Week 13**: Deploy RabbitMQ and Redis, configure Kong
- **Week 14**: Extract `cognitive-monitoring` with Fastify (real-time performance)
- **Week 15**: Extract `educator-alerts` with Fastify (high throughput)
- **Week 16**: Set up comprehensive monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)

### Phase 4: Complete Migration & Optimize (Weeks 17-20)
- **Week 17**: Extract `educational-ai-core` with NestJS (complex orchestration)
- **Week 18**: Extract `academic-integrity` with NestJS (business rules)
- **Week 19**: End-to-end testing and framework optimization
- **Week 20**: Performance tuning and deployment optimization

## Technical Stack

### Backend Frameworks (Hybrid Approach)
- **Fastify**: Main API and high-performance MCP servers (2-3x faster than Express)
- **NestJS**: Complex MCP servers requiring enterprise patterns and DI
- **MCP Protocol**: Claude Code native integration

### Infrastructure & Messaging
- **RabbitMQ**: Asynchronous messaging between services
- **Redis Cluster**: Distributed caching
- **Kong**: API Gateway with framework-agnostic routing
- **Docker/Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Monitoring

## Cost Impact
- **Infrastructure**: +$330/month (+47%)
- **Framework migration effort**: One-time $15k investment (training + refactoring)
- **Development efficiency**: +$12k/month saved (enhanced by better frameworks)
- **Performance gains**: +$8k/month from reduced infrastructure needs (Fastify efficiency)
- **Revenue impact**: +$50k/month from faster features
- **Net benefit**: $69,670/month (after framework investment amortized)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Phased approach** minimizes disruption
- **Framework-specific rollback procedures** (Express fallback maintained)
- **Comprehensive monitoring** from day one
- **Structured team training** on Fastify (Week 1) and NestJS (Week 6)
- **Framework expertise** through proof-of-concept implementations
- **Gradual adoption** starting with main API (lowest risk, highest impact)

## Success Metrics
- Service response time < 100ms (p95) for Fastify services, < 200ms for NestJS
- Main API throughput increased 2-3x (Fastify migration)
- System availability > 99.9%
- 3x increase in deployment frequency
- 50% faster feature development
- 90% team proficiency in new frameworks by Week 12

## Next Steps
1. Team review and feedback on hybrid framework approach
2. Fastify proof of concept with main API endpoints
3. NestJS proof of concept with `writing-analysis` service
4. Framework training materials preparation
5. Infrastructure provisioning
6. Begin Phase 1 implementation with Fastify migration
