## 🔍 Key Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Class Analytics Algorithm
```typescript
// Multi-dimensional assessment:
- Student count and engagement metrics
- AI usage patterns and dependency rates
- Reflection quality aggregation
- Completion rate tracking
- Boundary effectiveness scoring (0-100)
```

### 2. Student Segmentation Algorithm
```typescript
// Five distinct segments:
- Thriving: High independence + quality (>70% each)
- Progressing: Steady improvement trajectory
- Struggling: High cognitive load despite AI usage
- Over-dependent: >5 interactions/hour + declining quality
- Under-utilizing: High load + low AI usage
```

### 3. Pattern Detection Algorithm
```typescript
// Four auto-adjustment patterns:
- Over-dependence: >60% students dependent
- Under-utilization: <30% usage + >40% struggling
- Low engagement: <40% reflection quality + >50% usage
- Completion challenges: <50% completion + >120min average
```

### 4. Temporal Strategy Algorithm
```typescript
// Phase-based optimization:
- Early (0-33%): More exploratory support (7-8 questions/hour)
- Middle (33-67%): Balanced independence building (4-5/hour)
- Late (67-100%): Minimal revision support (2-3/hour)
```
