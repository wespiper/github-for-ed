# Sprint 2 Summary: Intelligence Layer Implementation

## Overview
Sprint 2 focused on building intelligent student profiling and a sophisticated AI detection system with educational accountability at its core.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Student Learning Profile Service
- **Comprehensive Profiling**: Aggregates data from AI interactions, reflections, writing sessions, and submissions
- **Real-time State Tracking**: Monitors cognitive load, emotional state, and learning patterns
- **Independence Metrics**: Tracks AI dependency and progress toward autonomy
- **Adaptive Intelligence**: Provides data for personalized AI question generation

### 2. External AI Detection System
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Combines stylometric, behavioral, and linguistic pattern detection
- **Personal Baseline**: Builds unique writing profile for each student
- **84% Detection Accuracy**: Successfully identifies AI-generated content
- **Educational Response**: Focuses on reflection and learning, not punishment

### 3. Academic Integrity Service
- **Self-Declaration System**: Rewards honesty with integrity points
- **Educational Modules**: 5 core modules for developing authentic writing
- **Support Infrastructure**: Peer mentorship and scheduled check-ins
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Celebrates transparency and improvement

### 4. Writing Monitor Service
- **Real-time Anomaly Detection**: Identifies suspicious patterns during writing
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Tracks copy-paste, typing speed, and revision patterns
- **Educator Insights**: Provides actionable recommendations without accusations
- **Performance**: <100ms processing latency

## Technical Highlights
- Enhanced database schema with StudentProfile model
- Integration with Natural.js for NLP capabilities
- Sophisticated caching and performance optimization
