      The question about "who might disagree" really struck a nerve because I realized I'd been 
      writing in an echo chamber. I spent most of yesterday evening thinking about my uncle Jim, 
      who's skeptical about climate science. At first, I wanted to dismiss his views, but then I 
      remembered our Thanksgiving conversation where he actually made some points about economic 
      impacts that I hadn't considered. This made me completely restructure my introduction. 
      Instead of starting with alarming statistics (which would immediately turn off readers like 
      him), I'm now beginning with shared values about protecting local jobs and communities. 
      It's harder to write this way because I have to constantly check my assumptions, but I 
      think it will ultimately be more persuasive. I'm still struggling with how to present 
      scientific data without seeming preachy - maybe I need to use more local examples?`,
