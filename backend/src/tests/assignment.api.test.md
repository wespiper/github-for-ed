## **COMPREHENSIVE API ENDPOINT INVENTORY**

### **Core CRUD Operations** (Required by Ticket)
1. `POST /api/assignments` - Create assignment
2. `GET /api/assignments/:id` - Get single assignment  
3. `PUT /api/assignments/:id` - Update assignment
4. `DELETE /api/assignments/:id` - Delete assignment
5. `GET /api/courses/:id/assignments` - Get course assignments

### **Extended Assignment API** (Bonus Features)
6. `GET /api/assignments/my-assignments` - Get instructor's assignments
7. `GET /api/assignments/course/:courseId` - Alternative course assignments endpoint
8. `POST /api/assignments/:id/submit` - Create/get assignment submission
9. `GET /api/assignments/:id/submissions` - Get assignment submissions (instructor)
10. `PATCH /api/assignments/:id/publish` - Publish assignment
11. `POST /api/assignments/:id/clone` - Clone assignment
12. `POST /api/assignments/:id/validate` - Validate assignment before publishing

### **Educational Query Endpoints** (Advanced Features)
13. `GET /api/assignments/by-objective/:category` - Filter by learning objective
14. `GET /api/assignments/by-blooms/:level` - Filter by Bloom's taxonomy level
15. `GET /api/assignments/multi-stage` - Get multi-stage assignments
16. `GET /api/assignments/with-ai` - Get AI-enabled assignments

## **VALIDATION & ERROR HANDLING**

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- All endpoints require authentication via JWT token
- Role-based access control (student, educator, admin)
- Course enrollment validation for students
- Assignment ownership validation for instructors

### **Request Validation**
- MongoDB ObjectId format validation
- Required field validation (title, description, instructions)
- Field length constraints (title ≤ 200 chars, description ≤ 2000 chars)
- Enum validation (assignment type, status)
- Learning objectives weight sum validation (must equal 100%)
- Writing stages order uniqueness validation

### **Business Logic Validation**
- Course existence and access permissions
- Assignment ownership for updates/deletes
- Student enrollment for submissions
- Assignment publication status for student access
- Collaboration settings consistency
- AI settings stage reference validation

### **Error Response Format**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message",
  "details": ["Specific validation errors"]
}
```

### **Success Response Format**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation completed successfully", 
  "data": { /* response data */ }
}
```

## **API TESTING VERIFICATION**

### **Manual Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Authentication required for all endpoints
- [ ] Students can only see published assignments
- [ ] Instructors can see all assignments in their courses
- [ ] Validation errors return 400 with details
- [ ] Permission errors return 403
- [ ] Not found errors return 404
- [ ] Server errors return 500 with logging

### **Integration Testing**
- [ ] Complete assignment lifecycle (create → update → publish → delete)
- [ ] Student assignment access (enrollment → view published → submit)
- [ ] Instructor assignment management (create → manage submissions → grade)
- [ ] Learning objectives validation (weights sum to 100%)
- [ ] Writing stages validation (unique orders)

### **Performance Considerations**
- [ ] Database queries use proper indexes
- [ ] Populated data is selective (only needed fields)
- [ ] Large result sets are properly paginated
- [ ] Query filters reduce data transfer

## **CONCLUSION**
