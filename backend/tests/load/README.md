- `system_stability_under_privacy_load`: System stability with privacy features active

### Regulation-Specific Metrics
- `gdpr_*_success`: GDPR operation success rates
- `ccpa_*_success`: CCPA operation success rates  
- `ferpa_*_success`: FERPA operation success rates

## Performance Targets

| Operation | Target | Regulation | Priority |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------|
| Consent Collection | <500ms | All | High |
| Consent Validation | <50ms | All | High |
| Data Access Request | <30min | GDPR | High |
| Data Deletion | <1hr | GDPR/CCPA | High |
| Privacy Alert | <1s | All | High |
| Educational Access Control | <200ms | FERPA | High |

## Load Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Mass Consent Collection
- **Load**: 2000 new students registering
- **Duration**: 4 hours
- **Focus**: Consent database performance, preference propagation

### Scenario 2: Privacy Rights Exercise Peak
- **Load**: 500 concurrent data access requests
- **Duration**: 2 hours
- **Focus**: Request processing, data compilation, audit trails

### Scenario 3: Educational Privacy Operations
- **Load**: 1000+ students with mixed privacy preferences
- **Duration**: 6 hours (full academic day)
- **Focus**: Real-time consent validation, data filtering, access control

### Scenario 4: Privacy System Stress
- **Load**: Up to 200 virtual users
- **Duration**: 15 minutes
- **Focus**: System breaking points, failure modes, recovery
