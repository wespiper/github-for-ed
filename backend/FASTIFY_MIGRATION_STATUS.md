# Fastify Migration Status

## Overview
Migration of backend services from Express to Fastify, maintaining hybrid architecture with both servers running.

## Migration Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed Migrations

#### 1. Authentication Routes (`/api/auth/*`)
- Status: **COMPLETE**
- Files:
  - `/backend/src/fastify/routes/auth.ts` - Created
  - Endpoints: login, verify, register, profile
- Notes: JWT authentication integrated

#### 2. AI Routes (`/api/ai/*`)
- Status: **COMPLETE**
- Files:
  - `/backend/src/fastify/routes/ai.ts` - Created
  - Endpoints: generate, capabilities
- Notes: Rate limiting configured

#### 3. Educator Alerts Routes (`/api/educator-alerts/*`)
- Status: **COMPLETE**
- Files:
  - `/backend/src/fastify/routes/educatorAlerts.ts` - Created
  - Endpoints: create, list, :alertId, dismiss, respond, metrics
- Notes: TypeBox schema validation

#### 4. Writing Analysis Routes (`/api/analytics/*`)
- Status: **COMPLETE**
- Files:
  - `/backend/src/fastify/routes/analytics.ts` - Created
  - `/backend/src/routes/analytics.resilient.ts` - Removed
  - Endpoints: All 8 MCP tools + privacy-enhanced endpoints
- Integration: AdaptiveWritingAnalysisManager with fallback support

#### 5. Student Profiling Routes (`/api/student-profiling/*`)
- Status: **COMPLETE**
- Files:
  - `/backend/src/fastify/routes/studentProfiling.ts` - Created
  - `/backend/src/routes/studentProfiling.ts` - Removed
  - Endpoints: All 8 student profiling tools
- Integration: StudentProfilingService with triple-tier architecture

### üîß Migration Infrastructure

#### Traffic Router
- Status: **ACTIVE**
- Configuration:
  - `/backend/src/middleware/router.ts` - Traffic routing middleware
  - `/backend/src/config/migration.ts` - Migration configuration
  - Supports parameterized routes (e.g., `/api/educator-alerts/:alertId`)
  - Percentage-based traffic splitting (controlled by `FASTIFY_TRAFFIC_PERCENTAGE`)

#### Server Configuration
- Express: Port 5001 (default)
- Fastify: Port 3001 (default)
- Both servers share:
  - PostgreSQL connection via Prisma
  - ServiceFactory for dependency injection
  - Event-driven architecture

### üìã Remaining Express Routes

These routes still need migration to Fastify:

1. `/api/courses/*` - Course management
2. `/api/admin/*` - Admin functionality
3. `/api/documents/*` - Document handling
4. `/api/assignments/*` - Assignment management
5. `/api/assignment-templates/*` - Template management
6. `/api/course-assignments/*` - Course assignment linking
7. `/api/submissions/*` - Submission handling
8. `/api/notifications/*` - Notification system
9. `/api/learning-objectives/*` - Learning objective management
10. `/api/reflections/*` - Reflection management
11. `/api/boundaries/*` - Boundary intelligence

### üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Enable Traffic Routing** (Immediate)
   - Set `FASTIFY_TRAFFIC_PERCENTAGE=100` in `.env` to route all migrated endpoints to Fastify
   - Monitor logs for any routing issues

2. **TypeScript Compilation Issues** (Current)
   - Fix remaining type errors in build
   - Update repository interfaces to match implementations
   - Add missing NestJS dependencies

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Test all migrated endpoints with Postman/curl
   - Verify JWT authentication works across both servers
   - Test traffic splitting at different percentages

4. **Continue Migration**
   - Prioritize high-traffic endpoints for migration
   - Consider grouping related endpoints (e.g., all assignment-related routes)
   - Maintain backward compatibility during migration

### üìä Metrics

- Total Endpoints Migrated: 33
- Services Using MCP Architecture: 3 (Educator Alerts, Writing Analysis, Student Profiling)
- TypeBox Schemas Created: 25+
- Express Routes Removed: 3

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

1. **TypeScript Build Errors**
   - Multiple repository interface mismatches
   - Missing NestJS common module (now installed)
   - Type assertions needed in catch blocks

2. **Service Dependencies**
   - Some services expect NestJS decorators but run in Fastify context
   - Need to standardize service initialization patterns

3. **Testing**
   - Integration tests need updates for dual-server architecture
   - E2E tests should cover both Express and Fastify endpoints
