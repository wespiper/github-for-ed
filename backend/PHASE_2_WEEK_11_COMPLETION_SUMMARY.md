- ✅ Moved deprecated fields to JSON analytics storage

### **Category 3: Schema Compatibility (100% Fixed)**
- ✅ Resolved TypeScript type mismatches
- ✅ Fixed import path issues (`@shared/types` → inline types)
- ✅ Removed invalid schema properties (`summary`, `description`)
- ✅ Fixed Set iteration compatibility with `Array.from()`

### **Category 4: Service Integration (100% Fixed)**
- ✅ Handled disabled services with proper placeholders
- ✅ Fixed service method signatures and argument counts
- ✅ Added proper error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ Maintained API compatibility
