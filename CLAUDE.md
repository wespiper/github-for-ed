## Architecture Overview

Scribe Tree is a monorepo containing a React frontend and Node.js backend for teaching writing using version control concepts with responsible AI integration.

**Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI
**Backend**: Event-driven microservices architecture with Node.js + Express + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + Prisma
**Structure**: Separate `/frontend` and `/backend` directories with independent package.json files

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **ServiceFactory**: Dependency injection container managing all services
- **EventBus**: Privacy-enhanced educational domain events with AES-256-CBC encryption
- **Repository Pattern**: Privacy-aware data access with audit trails and consent management
- **Cache Layer**: Privacy-aware Redis + in-memory with consent-based TTL strategies
- **Message Queues**: RabbitMQ + in-memory with encrypted privacy event routing
- **Monitoring**: Correlation IDs, health checks, privacy metrics, and compliance tracking

## Development Commands

### Frontend (React + Vite)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev     # Development server on http://localhost:5173
npm run build   # TypeScript compilation + Vite production build
npm run lint    # ESLint checking
npm run preview # Preview production build
```

### Backend (Node.js + Express)

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev     # Nodemon with ts-node hot reload on http://localhost:5001
npm run build   # TypeScript compilation to ./dist
npm run start   # Production server from compiled JS
```

## Setup Requirements

1. Install dependencies in both directories: `npm install`
2. Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`
3. Ensure PostgreSQL is running (local or provide DATABASE_URL)
4. Run Prisma migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
5. Run both frontend and backend concurrently for development

## Key Configuration

### Path Aliases
- Frontend uses `@/*` mapping to `./src/*` (configured in tsconfig.json and vite.config.ts)
- Import components as `@/components/ui/button` instead of relative paths

### ShadCN UI Setup
- Pre-configured with "New York" style variant
- Add components: `npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]`
- Components installed to `frontend/src/components/ui/`

### Database Connection
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Connection string via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Automatic schema synchronization with `prisma db push`

### Service Architecture
- **Repository Pattern**: All data access via repository interfaces
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate via educational domain events
- **ServiceFactory**: Dependency injection container in `src/container/ServiceFactory.ts`
- **Cache Abstraction**: Educational cache patterns with Redis/in-memory backends
- **Message Queues**: RabbitMQ/in-memory for asynchronous service communication

### Reflection System
- **Quality Analysis**: Multi-dimensional assessment (depth, self-awareness, critical thinking, growth mindset)
- **Progressive Access**: AI assistance levels based on reflection quality (restricted â†’ basic â†’ standard â†’ enhanced)
- **Educational Analytics**: Class trends, individual progress tracking, quality distribution
- **Real-time Events**: Reflection analysis triggers student progress and intervention events

## Git Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Standards

- **Author Attribution**: ALL commits should reflect the repository owner as the sole author
- **No AI Attribution**: NEVER include Claude Code or AI assistant attribution in commit messages
- **Clear Descriptions**: Write descriptive commit messages that explain the changes made
- **Professional Tone**: Use professional language appropriate for a public repository

### Prohibited Attribution Patterns

DO NOT include any of the following in commit messages:
```
ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

The repository owner is the sole author and contributor to this codebase.

## Development Standards

### Repository Pattern Implementation
- Use mock-first development for all new services
- Implement dependency injection with ServiceFactory pattern
- Create repository interfaces before database implementation
- Abstract data access for testability and future microservices
- Include privacy context in all repository methods
- Implement audit trails for sensitive data operations

### Performance Standards
- Real-time monitoring: <100ms response time
- Analytics queries: <500ms response time
- Privacy encryption/decryption: <100ms per operation
- Document performance targets in feature specifications
- Set clear targets early to prevent architecture problems
- Consider encryption overhead in performance planning

### Type Safety Guidelines
- Prefer pragmatic type assertions over blocking progress
- Document type compromises with TODO comments
- Plan iterative type improvements in technical debt backlog
- Use Prisma-generated types for database operations

### API Design Standards
- Standard response format: `{ success: boolean, data: T, message?: string }`
- Consistent error responses with development details when appropriate
- Educational endpoints may require specialized non-CRUD approaches
- Complete API endpoint inventory during migrations

## Privacy Standards

### Data Protection
- **Student ID Hashing**: Never store raw student IDs in events or logs
- **AES-256-CBC Encryption**: Use for all sensitive data in events and cache
- **Consent Management**: Verify consent before any student data access
- **Data Minimization**: Only expose necessary fields based on role/purpose
- **Audit Trails**: Log all data access with educational justification

### Privacy Implementation
- Include `PrivacyContext` in all service operations
- Use `PrivacyEventUtils` for student ID hashing and encryption
- Implement privacy-aware TTL strategies in cache
- Publish privacy events for all sensitive operations
- Test privacy scenarios (414+ test cases as baseline)

### Compliance Requirements
- **GDPR**: Data minimization, purpose limitation, consent management
- **FERPA**: Educational records protection, parent access rights
- **COPPA**: Special protections for users under 13
- **State Laws**: California CCPA, state-specific education privacy laws

## Testing Requirements

### Mock Repository Testing
- Create complete mock implementations for all repositories
- Test repository contracts independently of database
- Use mock repositories for service unit tests
- Validate interface design before complex implementation
- Include privacy testing scenarios (consent, audit, data minimization)
- Test encryption/decryption in mock implementations

### Migration Testing
- Maintain test coverage during all migrations
- Update tests incrementally with implementation
- Validate API contracts between frontend and backend
- Use admin accounts to test role-based access patterns

### Educational Workflow Testing
- Test with actual educators and students regularly
- Validate educational outcomes, not just technical function
- Ensure features support learning process visibility
- Test AI boundaries and reflection requirements

## Educational Philosophy

### Trust Through Transparency
- Reward AI use disclosure with integrity points
- Frame detection as educational accountability
- Build features that students want to engage with
- All AI contributions visible to educators for assessment

### Multi-Dimensional Support
- Consider cognitive load in AI responses
- Adapt to emotional state, not just academic level
- Monitor without interrupting creative flow
- Support should enhance, not replace, thinking

### Process Over Product
- Make invisible writing processes visible
- Track learning journey, not just outcomes
- Enable educator insights without surveillance
- Focus on student growth and independence

## Working with Event-Driven Architecture

### ServiceFactory Usage
```typescript
// Initialize services
const serviceFactory = ServiceFactory.getInstance();
await serviceFactory.initialize();

// Get services
const eventBus = serviceFactory.getEventBus();
const cache = serviceFactory.getCache();
const sessionRepo = serviceFactory.getWritingSessionRepository();
```

### Publishing Educational Events
```typescript
// Student progress events
await eventBus.publish<StudentProgressUpdatedEvent>({
  type: EventTypes.STUDENT_PROGRESS_UPDATED,
  correlationId: uuidv4(),
  timestamp: new Date(),
  payload: {
    studentId, courseId, assignmentId,
    progressType: 'reflection',
    metrics: { reflectionQuality: 85 }
  },
  metadata: { userId: studentId }
});
```

### Repository Pattern
```typescript
// Use repositories instead of direct Prisma calls
const reflections = await reflectionRepo.findByUser(userId, {
  assignmentId: 'assignment-123',
  type: 'ai_interaction',
  limit: 10
});

// Analysis with educational caching
const analysis = await reflectionAnalysisRepo.getQualityTrends(studentId);
```

### Cache Usage with Educational Patterns
```typescript
// Educational cache key patterns
const cacheKey = CacheKeyBuilder.studentProfile(studentId, assignmentId);
const cached = await cache.get<StudentLearningProfile>(cacheKey);
await cache.set(cacheKey, profile, { ttl: CacheTTL.STUDENT_STATE });
```
